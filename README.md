## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo


git clone https://github.com/tonymphomilanzi/crypto-converter.git
cd crypto-converter


2. Install dependencies
npm install


3. Run the app
npm run dev 


## API Usage (CoinGecko)
We're using the simple/price and coins/list endpoints to:

Fetch exchange rates
GET https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=bitcoin&vs_currencies=usd

Fetch full list of coins (names, symbols, IDs)

‚ö†Ô∏è This setup does not use a backend, so some fiat currencies like MWK may face CORS issues when hosted locally.
On production hosts like Vercel or Netlify, CORS is typically not an issue.
